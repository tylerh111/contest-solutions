# Contributing
This repository is an archive of solutions for **archived** programming contests.
Anyone can contribute to this repository in the effort of preserving interesting problems and even more interesting solutions.

My goal is to enable the sharing of good solutions, bad solutions, interesting approaches, and enlightened discussions.
This also extends beyond the algorithmic problem/solution.
Different languages can provide interesting design patterns that enable inspiring solution. 


## Contributing Instructions
To contribute to the repository of contest solutions, you may either send me your diffs or create a pull request on Github.

Each contest problem should have the following:
- Problem Link
    - add link to the contest's `README.md` file
- Problem Folder
    - add folder with the content below
- Problem Description
    - either a pdf or plain text document
    - required:
        - problem statement
        - expected input
        - expected output
    - optional:
        - test cases
        - reference material
- Problem Solution
    - any language is allowed
    - keep external dependencies to a minimum (or make them optional)
    - be sure to commit any related material (for instance, code/data generation)
    - build instructions are not necessary
    - the 'would-be' submission should be a single file

Each solution should be its own commit.
Do not edit other solutions while adding a solution.

It is optional to add metadata to the solutions as comments at the top of the solutions file.
This could include the following:
- author
- date
- build instructions
- build requirements
- test environment (e.g. 'tested on Windows', 'tested with python 3.x', etc.)
- test cases

The directory structure should be preserved.
Each contest should have it's own directory.
Each problem should have it's own directory inside a contest directory.
All relevant information should be committed in the problem directory.
All directory names should be lower case and 'dash'-separated.

Each contest directory should have a `README.md` file that has the following information:
- contest name
- contest link
- list of contest problems in this repository
    - name of contest problem
    - link to contest problem


## Code of Conduct
Again, these are solutions for archived contests.
There should be no solutions for active contests.

If there is already a solution to a problem for which you want to attempt, create a new solution.
The new solution could be a different approach or use a different language.
Do not submit code that simply a copy-paste of another solution for the same problem.
